When testing with the Storybook examples, I noticed the 'expand by default' does nothing.

I also noticed clicking the trianges to expand and collapse the tree does nothing.

As a user, I expect that when I collapse a node:

- the visual indicator changes to the collapsed state
- child nodes of the collapsed node no longer appear


As a user, I expect that when I expand a node:

- the visual indicator changes to the expanded state
- child nodes of the collapsed node appear
