# Step 8: Collapse/Expand Functionality

## Context

This step adds the core tree view functionality of collapsing and expanding nodes. We need to track which nodes are expanded, update the visible nodes list dynamically, and add UI controls for toggling expansion state. This dramatically improves usability for large trees.

## Prompt

```text
Implement collapse/expand functionality for the tree view:

1. Update TreeState class to track expansion state:
   - Add Set<Uri> expandedPaths to track which nodes are expanded
   - Add methods:
     * toggleExpanded(Uri path)
     * isExpanded(Uri path)
     * expandAll()
     * collapseAll()
     * getVisibleNodes() - returns only nodes that should be shown
   - Update visible nodes calculation:
     * Always show root nodes
     * Show children only if all ancestors are expanded
   
2. Add expansion UI to ReorderableTreeListViewItem:
   - Add leading expand/collapse icon for folder nodes
   - Use RotationTransition for smooth icon animation
   - Icon should be:
     * Icons.expand_more when collapsed
     * Rotated 180Â° when expanded
     * Hidden for leaf nodes
   - Add IconButton with proper padding and alignment
   
3. Update ReorderableTreeListView state management:
   - Track TreeState with expanded paths
   - Update itemCount to use visibleNodes.length
   - Handle expand/collapse actions:
     * Update TreeState
     * Trigger setState to rebuild
     * Maintain smooth animations
   
4. Add expansion-related constructor parameters:
   - bool expandedByDefault = true
   - Set<Uri>? initiallyExpanded
   - bool animateExpansion = true
   
5. Implement proper animations:
   - Use AnimatedList for smooth add/remove of nodes
   - Or use implicit animations for simpler implementation
   - Ensure expand/collapse is smooth and responsive
   
6. Update example to demonstrate:
   - Tree with some nodes initially collapsed
   - Expand/collapse interactions
   - Deep nesting behavior
   - Performance with many nodes
   
7. Create comprehensive tests:
   - Expansion state management
   - Visible nodes calculation
   - UI interaction tests
   - Animation completion tests

Ensure the tree remains functional with ReorderableListView during expansion changes.
Performance must be good even with 1000+ nodes.
```

## Expected Outcome

- Fully functional expand/collapse
- Smooth animations
- Intuitive UI controls
- Efficient state management
- Ready for advanced interactions
