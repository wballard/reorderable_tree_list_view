# Step 9: Drag and Drop Implementation

## Context

Now we implement the complete drag-and-drop functionality that allows users to reorder items and move them between different parent nodes. This is complex because we need to calculate new paths based on drop positions while maintaining tree integrity.

## Prompt

```text
Implement full drag-and-drop functionality with path recalculation:

1. Create DragDropHandler class in lib/src/core/drag_drop_handler.dart:
   - calculateNewPath(Uri draggedPath, int newIndex, List<TreeNode> visibleNodes)
     * Determine the new parent based on drop position
     * Calculate the new path preserving the leaf name
     * Handle drops between items (sibling) vs. into folders
   - validateDrop(Uri source, Uri targetParent)
     * Prevent dropping a parent into its own child
     * Ensure valid path operations
   
2. Enhance ReorderableTreeListView's onReorder implementation:
   - When an item is dragged to a new position:
     * Calculate the target parent path
     * Create new URI with same leaf name but new parent
     * Update the paths list
     * Rebuild the tree
     * Call user callbacks
   
3. Add visual feedback during drag:
   - Implement custom proxyDecorator:
     * Show elevation/shadow
     * Slightly scale the dragged item
     * Add opacity to indicate it's being moved
   - Add drop indicators:
     * Show where the item will be placed
     * Different indicators for sibling vs. child placement
   
4. Add drag-and-drop related callbacks:
   - ValueChanged<Uri>? onDragStart
   - ValueChanged<Uri>? onDragEnd  
   - bool Function(Uri, Uri)? onWillAcceptDrop
   - void Function(Uri oldPath, Uri newPath)? onReorder
   
5. Implement smart drop zones:
   - Dropping on a folder moves item into it
   - Dropping between items makes them siblings
   - Auto-expand folders on hover during drag
   - Visual feedback for valid/invalid drops
   
6. Update the example to show:
   - Moving files between folders
   - Reordering within the same level
   - Invalid drop prevention
   - Complex tree reorganization
   
7. Create comprehensive tests:
   - Path calculation logic
   - Drop validation
   - Complex reordering scenarios
   - Edge cases (root items, deep nesting)

Ensure drag-and-drop is intuitive and provides clear visual feedback.
Performance must remain good during drag operations.
```

## Expected Outcome

- Full drag-and-drop functionality
- Intelligent path recalculation
- Clear visual feedback
- Robust validation
- Intuitive user experience
