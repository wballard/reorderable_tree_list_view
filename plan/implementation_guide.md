# ReorderableTreeListView Implementation Guide

## Overview

This plan provides a complete roadmap for implementing a sophisticated Flutter tree view widget that combines hierarchical data visualization with drag-and-drop capabilities. The implementation is broken down into 16 incremental steps, each building upon the previous ones.

## Implementation Order

### Foundation (Steps 1-3)
1. **Project Setup** - Initialize Flutter package with dependencies
2. **Data Model** - Create URI-based tree node structure  
3. **Tree Building** - Implement logic to build trees from sparse paths

### Core Widgets (Steps 4-6)
4. **Main Widget** - Create ReorderableTreeListView widget
5. **Item Widget** - Implement ReorderableTreeListViewItem
6. **ListView Integration** - Connect with Flutter's ReorderableListView

### Visual Features (Steps 7-9)
7. **Theming** - Add Material Design theming and indentation
8. **Expand/Collapse** - Implement tree node expansion
9. **Drag & Drop** - Complete reordering functionality

### Advanced Features (Steps 10-12)
10. **Keyboard Navigation** - Full accessibility support
11. **Actions/Intents** - Modern Flutter event handling
12. **Callbacks** - Traditional event callbacks

### Documentation & Testing (Steps 13-16)
13. **Storybook Setup** - Interactive documentation framework
14. **Examples** - Comprehensive usage examples
15. **Testing** - Unit, widget, and integration tests
16. **Polish** - Final optimization and release preparation

## Key Design Principles

- **URI-based paths**: Flexible representation of hierarchical data
- **Builder pattern**: Maximum customization flexibility
- **Material Design**: Following Flutter's design guidelines
- **Accessibility first**: Full keyboard and screen reader support
- **Performance**: Efficient handling of large datasets
- **Modern patterns**: Actions/Intents for clean architecture

## Getting Started

To implement this widget:

1. Start with step_0001.md and work through each step sequentially
2. Each step builds on previous work - don't skip steps
3. Run tests after each step to ensure correctness
4. Use the Storybook examples to verify functionality

## Expected Timeline

- Steps 1-3: 1-2 days (Foundation)
- Steps 4-6: 2-3 days (Core functionality)
- Steps 7-9: 2-3 days (Essential features)
- Steps 10-12: 2-3 days (Advanced features)
- Steps 13-16: 3-4 days (Documentation & polish)

Total: 10-15 days for a production-ready widget

## Success Metrics

- All tests passing with 90%+ coverage
- Smooth performance with 1000+ nodes
- Full accessibility compliance
- Comprehensive documentation
- Working examples for all features
