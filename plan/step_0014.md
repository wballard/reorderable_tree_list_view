# Step 14: Basic Stories and Examples

## Context

Now we create comprehensive Storybook stories that demonstrate every feature of the widget. These stories serve as both documentation and functional examples that developers can copy and adapt for their own use.

## Prompt

```text
Create comprehensive Storybook stories showcasing all features:

1. Basic Usage Stories (example/stories/basic_stories.dart):
   - Simple file tree with 10-20 items
   - URL tree showing http:// paths
   - Mixed URI schemes (file://, http://, custom://)
   - Empty tree handling
   - Single item tree
   - Deep nesting example (5+ levels)
   
2. Interaction Stories (example/stories/interaction_stories.dart):
   - Drag and drop between folders
   - Reordering within same level  
   - Selection modes (none, single, multiple)
   - Expand/collapse animations
   - Context menu example
   - Touch vs mouse interaction differences
   
3. Theme Stories (example/stories/theme_stories.dart):
   - Material 3 default theme
   - Custom color schemes
   - Different indent widths
   - Custom nest indicators
   - Icon customization
   - Compact vs comfortable density
   
4. Data Stories (example/stories/data_stories.dart):
   - Large dataset (1000+ items)
   - Dynamic data updates
   - Async data loading
   - Real-time path changes
   - Search/filter implementation
   - Virtualization demo
   
5. Advanced Stories (example/stories/advanced_stories.dart):
   - Custom builders for specific paths
   - Integration with app state management
   - Persistent expansion state
   - Undo/redo functionality
   - Multi-window drag and drop
   - Custom keyboard shortcuts
   
6. For each story, include:
   - Clear title and description
   - Interactive knobs where appropriate
   - Code snippet showing implementation
   - Console logging for callbacks
   - Performance metrics display
   
7. Create realistic examples:
   - File explorer clone
   - Project navigator (like VS Code)
   - Category tree for e-commerce
   - Organization chart
   - Menu structure editor
   
8. Add copy-paste code snippets:
   - Each story should have a "Show Code" option
   - Provide both minimal and full examples
   - Include necessary imports
   - Add inline comments

Make stories progressively complex, starting simple and building up.
Ensure all features are demonstrated across the stories.
```

## Expected Outcome

- Complete feature demonstration
- Copy-ready code examples
- Interactive exploration
- Real-world use cases
- Performance showcases
