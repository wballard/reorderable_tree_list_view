# Step 10: Keyboard Navigation

## Context

Accessibility is crucial for a professional tree view widget. We need to implement comprehensive keyboard navigation that allows users to navigate, expand/collapse, and select items without using a mouse. This follows Material Design accessibility guidelines.

## Prompt

```text
Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation for accessibility:

1. Add focus management to ReorderableTreeListView:
   - Track currently focused node with FocusNode
   - Implement focus traversal between items
   - Visual focus indicators following Material Design
   - Maintain focus during tree updates
   
2. Implement keyboard shortcuts using RawKeyboardListener:
   - Arrow Up/Down: Navigate between visible items
   - Arrow Left: Collapse current node or move to parent
   - Arrow Right: Expand current node or move to first child
   - Home: Jump to first item
   - End: Jump to last visible item
   - Enter/Space: Activate item (invoke callback)
   - Tab: Standard focus traversal
   
3. Update ReorderableTreeListViewItem for keyboard support:
   - Make items focusable with proper FocusNode
   - Add keyboard event handling
   - Show focus ring using Material Design guidelines
   - Announce state changes for screen readers
   
4. Add selection support:
   - Track selected items (single or multiple selection)
   - Shift+Arrow for range selection
   - Ctrl/Cmd+Arrow for moving focus without selection
   - Ctrl/Cmd+Space for toggling selection
   - Visual indication of selected state
   
5. Constructor parameters for keyboard features:
   - bool enableKeyboardNavigation = true
   - SelectionMode selectionMode (none, single, multiple)
   - Set<Uri>? initialSelection
   - ValueChanged<Set<Uri>>? onSelectionChanged
   
6. Screen reader support:
   - Proper Semantics widgets
   - Announce tree structure
   - Announce expand/collapse state
   - Read item content appropriately
   
7. Update example to demonstrate:
   - Full keyboard navigation
   - Selection modes
   - Focus management
   - Accessibility features
   
8. Create accessibility tests:
   - Keyboard navigation sequences
   - Focus management
   - Screen reader announcements
   - Selection state management

Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for tree view accessibility.
Test with screen readers (TalkBack, VoiceOver).
```

## Expected Outcome

- Full keyboard navigation support
- Proper focus management
- Selection capabilities
- Screen reader compatibility
- WCAG 2.1 compliance
