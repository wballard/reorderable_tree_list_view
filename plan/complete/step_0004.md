# Step 4: Basic ReorderableTreeListView Widget

## Context

Now we create the main widget that users will interact with. This is a StatefulWidget that manages the tree state and provides the core API. We'll start with a basic implementation and add features incrementally.

## Prompt

```text
Create the main ReorderableTreeListView widget in lib/src/widgets/:

1. Create ReorderableTreeListView as a StatefulWidget in lib/src/widgets/reorderable_tree_list_view.dart with:
   
   Constructor parameters:
   - required List<Uri> paths - the sparse list of paths
   - required Widget Function(BuildContext, Uri) itemBuilder - builds widgets for leaf nodes
   - Widget Function(BuildContext, Uri)? folderBuilder - builds widgets for folders (optional)
   - ScrollController? scrollController
   - Axis scrollDirection = Axis.vertical
   - bool shrinkWrap = false
   - EdgeInsetsGeometry? padding
   - ScrollPhysics? physics
   
2. In the State class:
   - Use flutter_hooks for state management
   - Initialize TreeState from the provided paths using TreeBuilder
   - Create a simple build method that returns a Column with:
     * A Text widget showing "Tree with X nodes" for now
     * A basic ListView showing all paths (temporary implementation)
   
3. Add proper widget lifecycle:
   - Handle paths changing in didUpdateWidget
   - Dispose of resources properly
   
4. Export the widget in lib/reorderable_tree_list_view.dart

5. Update example/main.dart to show basic usage:
   - Create a simple app with sample paths
   - Use the ReorderableTreeListView
   - Provide basic itemBuilder and folderBuilder

6. Create a widget test in test/widgets/ that:
   - Creates the widget with sample paths
   - Verifies it builds without errors
   - Checks that the correct number of nodes are created

Ensure flutter analyze is clean and the example runs showing the temporary UI.
```

## Expected Outcome

- Main widget API established
- Basic state management in place
- Example app running
- Foundation for adding ReorderableListView integration
