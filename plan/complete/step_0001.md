# Step 1: Project Setup and Dependencies

## Context

We're creating a new Flutter package called `reorderable_tree_list_view`. This first step establishes the project structure, adds necessary dependencies, and creates the foundational files needed for our tree view widget.

## Prompt

```text
Create a new Flutter package called `reorderable_tree_list_view` with the following setup:

1. Initialize a Flutter package project structure
2. Configure pubspec.yaml with these dependencies:
   - flutter_hooks: ^0.20.5 (for state management)
   - storybook_flutter: ^0.14.0 (for development and examples)
   
3. Set up the basic library structure:
   - Create lib/reorderable_tree_list_view.dart as the main export file
   - Create lib/src/ directory for implementation files
   
4. Create a basic README.md that explains:
   - This is a tree view widget built on ReorderableListView
   - It uses URI paths to represent tree structure
   - It supports drag-and-drop reordering
   
5. Set up analysis_options.yaml with strict linting rules following Flutter best practices

6. Create a simple example/main.dart file that imports the package (placeholder for now)

7. Ensure the project follows Material Design and uses Material 3 theming

Make sure flutter analyze runs clean with no errors or warnings.
```

## Expected Outcome

- A properly structured Flutter package
- All dependencies configured
- Basic project files in place
- Clean static analysis
- Ready for implementation of core functionality
