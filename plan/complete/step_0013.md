# Step 13: Storybook Setup

## Context

Storybook provides an excellent way to showcase the widget's capabilities and serve as interactive documentation. We'll set up storybook_flutter to create a comprehensive showcase of all features, making it easy for developers to understand and experiment with the widget.

## Prompt

```text
Set up storybook_flutter for interactive documentation:

1. Create storybook structure in example/:
   - Rename example/main.dart to example/main_simple.dart
   - Create new example/main.dart with Storybook setup
   - Create example/stories/ directory for all stories
   
2. Set up main Storybook app in example/main.dart:
   - Initialize Storybook widget
   - Configure theme switcher (light/dark)
   - Add device preview for different screen sizes
   - Set up proper navigation between stories
   
3. Create story categories in example/stories/:
   - basic_stories.dart - Simple tree examples
   - interaction_stories.dart - Drag/drop, selection
   - theme_stories.dart - Theming and customization
   - data_stories.dart - Different data scenarios
   - accessibility_stories.dart - Keyboard and screen reader
   
4. Implement story utilities:
   - Create example/lib/story_helpers.dart with:
     * Sample data generators (file paths, URLs, etc.)
     * Common story wrappers
     * Mock callbacks that log to console
     * Performance monitoring helpers
   
5. Add knobs for interactive configuration:
   - Toggle features (animations, indicators, etc.)
   - Adjust theme properties (colors, spacing)
   - Change data sets dynamically
   - Control selection modes
   
6. Create a comprehensive welcome story:
   - Overview of the widget
   - Key features list
   - Links to specific examples
   - Code snippets for quick start
   
7. Add story documentation:
   - Each story should have description
   - Show relevant code snippets
   - Explain key concepts
   - Link to related stories
   
8. Configure storybook for web deployment:
   - Ensure web compatibility
   - Add proper meta tags
   - Configure for GitHub Pages
   - Create deployment script

The Storybook should serve as both documentation and testing ground.
Make it easy to explore all features interactively.
```

## Expected Outcome

- Professional Storybook setup
- Interactive feature exploration
- Clear documentation
- Ready for web deployment
- Developer-friendly examples
