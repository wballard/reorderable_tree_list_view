# Step 3: Tree Builder and Path Processing

## Context

With our data model in place, we now need to build the logic that takes a sparse list of URI paths and generates a complete tree structure. This includes creating intermediate folder nodes and maintaining proper sort order.

## Prompt

```text
Create the tree building logic in lib/src/core/:

1. Create TreeBuilder class in lib/src/core/tree_builder.dart with:
   - static List<TreeNode> buildFromPaths(List<Uri> paths) method that:
     * Takes a sparse list of URIs
     * Generates all intermediate paths
     * Creates TreeNode instances for each unique path
     * Sorts nodes properly (scheme first, then by path segments)
     * Marks original paths as leaves (isLeaf = true)
     * Marks generated intermediate paths as folders (isLeaf = false)
   
2. Implement proper sorting logic:
   - Root nodes (just scheme) come first
   - Within same parent, sort alphabetically
   - Maintain hierarchical order (parents before children)
   
3. Add a TreeState class in lib/src/core/tree_state.dart that:
   - Holds the complete list of TreeNodes
   - Maps Uri to TreeNode for quick lookup
   - Provides methods to get children of a node
   - Provides methods to get visible nodes (for later collapse/expand)
   
4. Example: Given paths [file://var/data/readme.txt, file://var/config.json], generate:
   - file:// (folder)
   - file://var (folder)
   - file://var/config.json (leaf)
   - file://var/data (folder)
   - file://var/data/readme.txt (leaf)

5. Create comprehensive unit tests for:
   - Building trees from various path configurations
   - Handling multiple schemes (file://, http://, etc.)
   - Empty path lists
   - Duplicate paths
   - Deep nesting scenarios
   - Proper sorting

6. Add performance considerations for large path lists (1000+ paths)

Ensure the implementation is efficient and handles edge cases gracefully.
All tests must pass and flutter analyze must be clean.
```

## Expected Outcome

- Robust tree building from sparse paths
- Efficient data structures for tree operations
- Proper sorting and hierarchy
- Ready for widget integration
