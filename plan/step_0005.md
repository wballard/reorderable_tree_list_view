# Step 5: ReorderableTreeListViewItem Widget

## Context

The ReorderableTreeListViewItem is the internal widget that wraps each node's content. It handles indentation, provides a consistent structure, and will later support expand/collapse UI. This widget is created automatically by the tree view and wraps the user-provided content.

## Prompt

```text
Create ReorderableTreeListViewItem widget in lib/src/widgets/:

1. Create ReorderableTreeListViewItem as a StatelessWidget in lib/src/widgets/reorderable_tree_list_view_item.dart with:
   
   Constructor parameters:
   - required TreeNode node - the tree node data
   - required Widget child - the user-provided widget
   - double indentWidth = 24.0 - width per depth level
   - Key? key - required for ReorderableListView
   
2. Implement the build method:
   - Use a Row widget containing:
     * SizedBox for indentation (width = node.depth * indentWidth)
     * Expanded widget containing the child
   - The entire row should have the key from the node
   
3. Add Material Design touches:
   - Use Material widget as the root
   - Add InkWell for tap feedback (prepare for selection later)
   - Use Theme.of(context) for any styling
   
4. Update ReorderableTreeListView to use this item widget:
   - Modify the temporary ListView to use ReorderableTreeListViewItem
   - Wrap user-provided widgets with this item
   - Pass proper keys for each item
   
5. Create widget tests for ReorderableTreeListViewItem:
   - Test indentation calculation
   - Test that child widget is properly displayed
   - Test Material theming integration
   
6. Update the example to show:
   - Different content at different depths
   - Visual hierarchy through indentation

Make sure the indentation is visually clear and follows Material Design spacing.
All tests must pass and flutter analyze must be clean.
```

## Expected Outcome

- Items properly indented based on depth
- Clean visual hierarchy
- Material Design compliance
- Ready for ReorderableListView integration
