# ReorderableTreeListView Development Plan

## Project Overview

ReorderableTreeListView is a sophisticated Flutter widget that combines the functionality of a hierarchical tree view with the drag-and-drop capabilities of ReorderableListView. This widget uses a unique path-based approach where developers provide a list of URIs, and the widget automatically constructs the tree structure, filling in missing intermediate paths.

## Core Architecture

The widget is built on top of Flutter's ReorderableListView, delegating list management and drag-and-drop functionality while adding tree-specific features:

- **Path-based data model**: Uses URIs to represent tree structure
- **Automatic node generation**: Creates intermediate folder nodes for sparse paths
- **Visual hierarchy**: Indents items based on path depth with Material Design theming
- **State management**: Tracks expanded/collapsed nodes internally
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation with Actions and Intents
- **Builder pattern**: Uses callbacks for maximum flexibility

## Development Approach

This plan breaks down the development into 16 incremental steps, each building on the previous:

1. **Foundation** (Steps 1-3): Project setup, data models, and path utilities
2. **Core Widgets** (Steps 4-6): Basic widget structure and ReorderableListView integration
3. **Visual Features** (Steps 7-8): Indentation, theming, and collapse/expand
4. **Interaction** (Steps 9-12): Drag-and-drop, keyboard navigation, and event handling
5. **Examples & Testing** (Steps 13-16): Storybook integration, examples, and comprehensive tests

## Key Design Decisions

- **URI-based paths**: Provides a flexible, familiar way to represent hierarchical data
- **ReorderableListView delegation**: Leverages existing Flutter functionality for reliable drag-and-drop
- **Material Design compliance**: Follows Flutter's design patterns and theming system
- **Builder pattern**: Allows developers to create custom widgets for any path
- **Intent-based actions**: Modern Flutter pattern for handling user interactions

## Success Criteria

The final implementation will:
- Handle sparse path lists efficiently
- Provide smooth animations for all interactions
- Support full keyboard navigation
- Integrate seamlessly with Material Design
- Include comprehensive examples via Storybook
- Pass all unit tests for core functionality
