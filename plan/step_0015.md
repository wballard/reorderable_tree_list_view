# Step 15: Comprehensive Unit Tests

## Context

A professional widget package needs comprehensive test coverage. We'll create unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests that ensure reliability and catch regressions. The tests should cover all features and edge cases.

## Prompt

```text
Create comprehensive test suite for the widget:

1. Unit Tests for Core Logic (test/unit/):
   - tree_node_test.dart:
     * Node creation and properties
     * Depth calculation
     * Path relationships
     * Key generation
   - tree_path_test.dart:
     * All utility methods
     * Edge cases (empty paths, root paths)
     * Invalid URI handling
   - tree_builder_test.dart:
     * Building from various path configurations
     * Sorting logic
     * Duplicate handling
     * Performance with large datasets
   - drag_drop_handler_test.dart:
     * Path recalculation
     * Drop validation
     * Complex reordering scenarios
   
2. Widget Tests (test/widgets/):
   - reorderable_tree_list_view_test.dart:
     * Widget creation and rendering
     * Props passing
     * State management
     * Updates and rebuilds
   - tree_item_test.dart:
     * Indentation calculation
     * Visual rendering
     * Interaction handling
   - expansion_test.dart:
     * Expand/collapse functionality
     * Animation completion
     * State persistence
   
3. Integration Tests (test/integration/):
   - drag_drop_test.dart:
     * Complete drag and drop flow
     * Visual feedback
     * Reordering results
   - keyboard_navigation_test.dart:
     * All keyboard shortcuts
     * Focus management
     * Selection behavior
   - actions_intents_test.dart:
     * Intent invocation
     * Action handling
     * Override behavior
   
4. Accessibility Tests (test/accessibility/):
   - screen_reader_test.dart:
     * Semantics tree
     * Announcements
     * Navigation feedback
   - keyboard_test.dart:
     * Tab traversal
     * Focus indicators
     * Shortcut conflicts
   
5. Performance Tests (test/performance/):
   - large_dataset_test.dart:
     * Rendering 1000+ items
     * Scroll performance
     * Memory usage
   - rebuild_efficiency_test.dart:
     * Minimal rebuilds
     * State change efficiency
   
6. Test Utilities (test/test_utils.dart):
   - Mock data generators
   - Custom matchers
   - Test widgets
   - Pump and settle helpers
   
7. Golden Tests (test/golden/):
   - Visual regression tests
   - Different themes
   - Various tree configurations
   - Platform differences
   
8. Coverage Requirements:
   - Aim for 90%+ code coverage
   - All public APIs tested
   - Edge cases covered
   - Error conditions handled

Use proper test descriptions and group related tests.
Mock external dependencies appropriately.
Ensure tests run quickly and reliably.
```

## Expected Outcome

- Comprehensive test coverage
- Reliable test suite
- Quick test execution
- Clear test documentation
- Regression prevention
