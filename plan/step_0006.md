# Step 6: Integration with ReorderableListView

## Context

This is a critical step where we replace the temporary ListView with Flutter's ReorderableListView. This gives us drag-and-drop functionality while maintaining our tree structure. The key insight is that we delegate list management to ReorderableListView while managing the tree state ourselves.

## Prompt

```text
Replace the temporary ListView with ReorderableListView integration:

1. Update ReorderableTreeListView's build method to use ReorderableListView:
   - Replace the temporary Column/ListView with ReorderableListView
   - Set itemCount to the number of visible nodes (all for now)
   - Implement itemBuilder that:
     * Gets the TreeNode for the current index
     * Calls itemBuilder or folderBuilder based on node.isLeaf
     * Wraps the result in ReorderableTreeListViewItem
     * Ensures each item has a unique ValueKey(node.key)
   
2. Implement basic onReorder callback:
   - For now, just print debug information
   - Store the onReorder logic for full implementation later
   - Add TODO comment for proper path recalculation
   
3. Add ReorderableListView customization:
   - Pass through scrollController, padding, shrinkWrap, etc.
   - Set buildDefaultDragHandles to true for desktop
   - Configure proxyDecorator for visual feedback during drag
   
4. Handle the widget lifecycle properly:
   - When paths change, rebuild the tree
   - Maintain scroll position if possible
   - Ensure smooth updates
   
5. Update the example to demonstrate:
   - A tree with multiple levels
   - Mix of files and folders
   - Basic reordering (even if not fully functional yet)
   
6. Create integration tests:
   - Verify ReorderableListView is being used
   - Test that all nodes are rendered
   - Test that items can be dragged (even if reorder isn't complete)

Note: Full reordering logic will be implemented in a later step. Focus on integration.
All tests must pass and the example must show draggable items.
```

## Expected Outcome

- ReorderableListView fully integrated
- Items can be dragged (visual feedback)
- Tree structure maintained
- Foundation for implementing proper reordering logic
