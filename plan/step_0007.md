# Step 7: Visual Indentation and Theming

## Context

Now we enhance the visual presentation of the tree view with proper Material Design theming, visual indicators for nesting levels, and polished indentation. The goal is to make the hierarchy immediately clear while maintaining a clean, modern appearance.

## Prompt

```text
Enhance the visual design with Material Design theming and nest indicators:

1. Create TreeTheme class in lib/src/theme/tree_theme.dart:
   - indentWidth: double (default from Theme's listTileTheme or 24.0)
   - nestIndicatorColor: Color (from Theme's dividerColor)
   - nestIndicatorWidth: double (default 1.0)
   - expandIconSize: double (default 24.0)
   - Use InheritedWidget pattern or create TreeThemeData
   
2. Add visual nest indicators to ReorderableTreeListViewItem:
   - For each depth level, show a vertical line
   - Use Theme's divider color/style
   - Position indicators at consistent intervals
   - Don't use old-style tree lines, just subtle depth indicators
   
3. Update ReorderableTreeListViewItem's build method:
   - Create a Row with:
     * Stack widget for nest indicators (vertical lines)
     * Proper spacing between indicators
     * The child widget with appropriate padding
   - Use CustomPaint or Container with borders for indicators
   
4. Add hover and focus states:
   - Use InkWell for hover feedback
   - Add focus highlighting for keyboard navigation
   - Ensure proper Material ripple effects
   
5. Add constructor parameters to ReorderableTreeListView:
   - TreeTheme? theme (optional custom theme)
   - bool showNestIndicators = true
   
6. Update the example to showcase:
   - Default Material 3 theming
   - Custom theme with different colors
   - Deep nesting to show indicators clearly
   - Both light and dark mode support
   
7. Create visual regression tests:
   - Screenshot tests for different theme configurations
   - Verify proper spacing and alignment
   - Test indicator rendering at various depths

Follow Material Design guidelines for spacing, colors, and interactions.
Ensure smooth animations and transitions where appropriate.
```

## Expected Outcome

- Beautiful Material Design tree view
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Subtle nest indicators
- Full theme customization
- Ready for expand/collapse UI
