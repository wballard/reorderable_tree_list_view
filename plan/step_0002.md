# Step 2: Tree Data Model with URI Paths

## Context

Now we need to create the core data structures that will represent our tree. We're using URIs as the primary way to identify nodes, which provides a flexible and familiar way to represent hierarchical data. Each node in the tree will be associated with a URI path.

## Prompt

```text
Create the tree data model in lib/src/models/ directory:

1. Create a TreeNode class in lib/src/models/tree_node.dart with:
   - final Uri path - the full URI path for this node
   - final int depth - calculated from path segments
   - final bool isLeaf - whether this is a leaf node (from original paths)
   - final String key - unique key for ReorderableListView (path.toString())
   - A method to get the node's display name (last path segment or scheme for root)
   - A method to get the parent path
   
2. Create a TreePath utilities class in lib/src/models/tree_path.dart with static methods:
   - List<Uri> generateIntermediatePaths(Uri path) - generates all parent paths
   - int calculateDepth(Uri path) - counts path segments
   - String getDisplayName(Uri path) - extracts display name from path
   - Uri? getParentPath(Uri path) - gets parent path or null for root
   - bool isAncestorOf(Uri ancestor, Uri descendant) - checks path relationships
   
3. Add comprehensive documentation comments explaining:
   - How URIs map to tree structure
   - Examples like file://var/data/readme.txt
   - How depth is calculated from segments
   
4. Create unit tests in test/models/ for:
   - TreeNode creation and properties
   - All TreePath utility methods
   - Edge cases like root paths, single segments, deep nesting

Example usage should show:
- Creating nodes from paths like Uri.parse('file://var/data/readme.txt')
- Generating intermediate paths: [file://, file://var, file://var/data]
- Calculating depth (3 for the above example)

Ensure all tests pass and flutter analyze is clean.
```

## Expected Outcome

- Clear data model for tree nodes
- Utility functions for path manipulation
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Foundation for building the tree from sparse paths
