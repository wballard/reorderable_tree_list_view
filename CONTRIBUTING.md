4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the style guidelines
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reorderable_tree_list_view.git
   cd reorderable_tree_list_view
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

4. **Run the example app**

   cd example
   flutter run
   ```

## Style Guidelines

### Dart Style Guide

We follow the official [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style). Key points:

- Use `dart format` to format your code
- Follow naming conventions (lowerCamelCase for variables, UpperCamelCase for types)
- Add dartdoc comments for all public APIs
- Keep lines under 80 characters when possible

### Code Organization

- Place each class in its own file
- Group related functionality in subdirectories
- Keep files focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful file and directory names

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names

Example test structure:
```dart
group('TreeBuilder', () {
  group('buildFromPaths', () {
    test('should create tree from flat list', () {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    test('should handle empty paths', () {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

### Documentation

- Add dartdoc comments for all public APIs
- Include code examples in documentation
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add entries to CHANGELOG.md

Example documentation:
```dart
/// Builds a tree structure from a list of URI paths.
/// 
/// Takes a sparse list of [paths] and generates a complete tree
/// structure including intermediate folder nodes.
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final paths = [
///   Uri.parse('file:///folder/file.txt'),
///   Uri.parse('file:///folder/subfolder/other.txt'),
/// ];
/// final nodes = TreeBuilder.buildFromPaths(paths);
/// ```
static List<TreeNode> buildFromPaths(List<Uri> paths) {
  // Implementation
}
```
