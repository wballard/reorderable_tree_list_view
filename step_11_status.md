# Step 11 Implementation Status

## Completed ✅

1. **Intent Classes** - All intent classes created in `lib/src/intents/`:
   - ActivateNodeIntent
   - CollapseNodeIntent
   - CopyNodeIntent
   - DeleteNodeIntent
   - ExpandNodeIntent
   - MoveNodeIntent
   - PasteNodeIntent
   - SelectNodeIntent
   - TreeCollapseAllIntent
   - TreeCopyIntent
   - TreeDeleteIntent
   - TreeExpandAllIntent
   - TreePasteIntent
   - TreeSelectAllIntent

2. **Action Classes** - All action classes created in `lib/src/actions/`:
   - ActivateNodeAction
   - CollapseNodeAction
   - CopyNodeAction
   - DeleteNodeAction
   - ExpandNodeAction
   - MoveNodeAction
   - PasteNodeAction
   - SelectNodeAction
   - TreeCollapseAllAction
   - TreeCopyAction
   - TreeDeleteAction
   - TreeExpandAllAction
   - TreePasteAction
   - TreeSelectAllAction
   - TreeViewAction (base class)

3. **ReorderableTreeListView Integration**:
   - Added Actions widget integration
   - Added keyboard navigation parameters (enableKeyboardNavigation, selectionMode, initialSelection, onSelectionChanged, onItemActivated)
   - Integrated KeyboardNavigationController
   - Integrated TreeFocusManager

4. **ReorderableTreeListViewItem Updates**:
   - Added focusNode parameter
   - Added isFocused parameter
   - Added isSelected parameter
   - Updated to use Actions.maybeInvoke pattern for intents
   - Added visual feedback for focus and selection states

5. **TreeViewShortcuts Widget** - Created with default keyboard shortcuts

6. **Keyboard Navigation** - Implemented with passing tests:
   - Tab focus management
   - Arrow key navigation (up/down/left/right)
   - Home key navigation
   - Enter/Space activation
   - Focus persistence during tree updates
   - Folder expansion/collapse with arrow keys

## Failing Tests (4 remaining) ❌

1. **Arrow left on leaf should move to parent** - The focus is not properly transferring to parent node
2. **End key should jump to last item** - End key navigation not working correctly
3. **Should disable keyboard navigation when flag is false** - Keyboard is still active when disabled
4. **Should announce tree structure with Semantics** - Semantic labels not properly configured

## Test Results

- Total tests: 168
- Passing: 161
- Failing: 7 (4 keyboard tests + 3 action tests)

## Next Steps

To complete Step 11:
1. Fix the remaining 4 keyboard navigation test failures
2. Fix the 3 failing action tests (these are testing that actions without dependencies work)
3. Add any missing test coverage for the Actions/Intents system
4. Ensure all functionality is properly integrated and working

The implementation is mostly complete with the Actions and Intents system fully in place and keyboard navigation largely working. The remaining issues are primarily edge cases in keyboard navigation and ensuring proper accessibility support.
